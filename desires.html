                    “ELEMENTS OF DESIRE” - AUTUMN 2016 TRAINING SERIES by
                    VALENTIN TSZIN<br>
                    including the IMPROVISATIONS at HIERONYMUS BOSCH. VISIONS
                    ALIVE exhibition.<br>
                  </span> <br>
                  All interested in the body as a tool of art are welcome.
                  Minimum physical preparation is needed. Theater/dance
                  background not mandatory.<br>
                  <br>
                  The autumn 2016 workshop series created by Valentin Tszin
                  focuses on basic element of research and exploration rooted in
                  body-movement based performance art.<br>
                  <br>
                  The central focus of the 3rd cycle: the elaboration of the
                  methodology “elements of desire”: the original cause of
                  movement - its desire.<br>
                  <br>
                  In this workshop the students will explore the concept of
                  desire as such and its basic compon<span class="text_exposed_show">ents:
                    what does the body desire and how does this desire allow for
                    the body to become inhuman? What are the basic elements of
                    metamorphosis of human body into inhuman? How does dance
                    capture this transformation into/as an art object?<br>
                    <br>
                    We begin with the natural body which is already programmed
                    and enter a dialogue of its double: its current existence in
                    the machine epoch, where technologies create forms: the
                    machine creates new possibilities of a human body and the
                    human preserves and records the alternatives of body states
                    created by the machine.<br>
                    <br>
                    Can dance become the existence of the body? Body always has
                    a double: could I call it human? – and the bifurcation: to
                    follow the body given (hedonism) – without knowing our
                    desires we pursue their attainment or its opposite
                    (stoicism), which opposes the program given.<br>
                    If we accept these two beginnings: two options of
                    interaction of these bodies to the outside world, we
                    originate playing field of absurd, mechanism.<br>
                    <br>
                    “Elements of desire” as a methodology is based on that exact
                    mechanism: dance as a search of the gratification of desire
                    of the body, which is unknown to itself.<br>

                    METHODOLOGY<br>
                    Method of Valentin Tszin is based on 4 components:<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Work with the physical body.<br>
                    <br>
                    Warm-up exercises (joints, muscles, skeleton); exercises to
                    strengthen the body centre, feeling of the periphery and
                    their interactions; strengthening and relaxation, balance.<br>
                    Techniques: combination of taekwondo, butoh and rhythmics.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Work with the conscious body.<br>
                    <br>
                    Exercises of refusal of actions. Research of body polyphony:
                    numerous variants of behaviour in the same situation.
                    Sensation of individual patterns. Biomechanics. Metronome.<br>
                    <br>
                    Based on drama and acting theatre techniques and Meyerhold’s
                    biomechanics.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Work with the bodies in a group.<br>
                    <br>
                    Improvisation on a given topic. Research of boundaries of
                    oneself and the other. Construction and deconstruction of
                    hierarchy of bodies in space. Modelling simple and complex
                    schemes “presence – perception”.<br>
                    <br>
                    We will use the theory of contemporary philosophers and
                    sociologists.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Work with composition and dramaturgy.<br>
                    <br>
                    Theory about existing strategies of creation of a public
                    action (performance). Depending on the course, we will
                    develop solo and/or group actions.<br>
