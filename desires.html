                    what does the body desire and how does this desire allow for                    the body to become inhuman? What are the basic elements of                    metamorphosis of human body into inhuman? How does dance                    capture this transformation into/as an art object?<br>                    <br>                    We begin with the natural body which is already programmed                    and enter a dialogue of its double: its current existence in                    the machine epoch, where technologies create forms: the                    machine creates new possibilities of a human body and the                    human preserves and records the alternatives of body states                    created by the machine.<br>                    <br>                    Can dance become the existence of the body? Body always has                    a double: could I call it human? – and the bifurcation: to                    follow the body given (hedonism) – without knowing our                    desires we pursue their attainment or its opposite                    (stoicism), which opposes the program given.<br>                    If we accept these two beginnings: two options of                    interaction of these bodies to the outside world, we                    originate playing field of absurd, mechanism.<br>                    <br>                    “Elements of desire” as a methodology is based on that exact                    mechanism: dance as a search of the gratification of desire                    of the body, which is unknown to itself.<br>                    <span> --------------------------</span><wbr><span class="word_break"></span><span>--------------------------</span><wbr><span                      class="word_break"></span><span>--------------------------</span><wbr><span                      class="word_break"></span>-------<br>                    METHODOLOGY<br>                    Method of Valentin Tszin is based on 4 components:<br>                    <br>                    1.
