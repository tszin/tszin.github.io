                    staged near Olimpiysky sports complex in Kyiv on June 12,                    starring butoh dancers Valentin Tszin and Flavia Ghisalberti                    with music by Audrey Chen (vocals), Phil Minton (vocals),                    Henrik Munkeby Norstebo (trombone), Thomas Rohrer (rabeca),                    and Michael Vorfeld (percussion). Of course, such reaction                    could address a myriad of outdoor performances, and, coming                    from a pianist who had performed Cage a number of times, was                    just too obvious. That night, however, another idea of Cage                    could take on a new meaning, if we replace “sound” with                    “sense,” which isn’t too much of a stretch, given 21st                    century urge to multisensory experiences. It seems that this                    is exactly what the show’s organizer, a highly imaginative                    music agency <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ukhomusic/"                      target="_blank">Ukho</a>,                    does best: making Kyiv’s audiences of all ages believe that                    music is not just sound.</p>                </div>                <br>                <p>It is the time of the day when the sun breaks up into pieces                  and scatters over the sky like – cherry blossom? pieces of                  flesh and blood? I walk past Olimpiysky stadium up the hill,                  until the voices of football fans recede into silence and the                  stadium’s UFO-looking roof emerges in front of my eyes – the                  place’s mysterious view indeed reminds of Pasolini’s desert                  landscapes. Few hundreds of unordered chairs await the                  audience; <em>Medea</em> is about to start.</p>                <p>Supposedly without a plot, this genre-bending opera has no                  melodic lines, let alone arias, but can be perceived as a                  counterpoint of sensorial threads, on the verge between stasis                  and narrative. Barefoot dancers, barely dressed in                  skin-colored clothes, emerge from the audience, writhing with                  pain. Their suffering becomes our suffering – we could almost                  touch them and do feel the cold of their freezing feet hitting                  the asphalt. Humming screams of Minton and Chen can hardly be                  perceived as sound, but rather as shades of silence that at                  once project agony and fill up the void. Complete silence                  would be just too intense – too intense to leave the audience                  one-on-one with the thriller thread of the performance, by                  Tszin and Ghisalberti. After several wild acts, such as Tszin                  getting up the metal construction, the couple meets in a                  static movement. Their Zen-like concentration and                  emotionally-charged slow motion vaguely reminds of New York’s                  Japanese dance couple <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/arts/dance/eiko-koma-at-lincoln-center-out-of-doors-review.html?_r=2&amp;emc=eta1"                    target="_blank">Eiko                    and Koma</a>. The subtle eroticism and the dancers’ cruelty                  to their own bodies, however, is definitely Pasolini’s:                  replace the mystery of this mixture of beauty and pain with                  his mysticism, and you arrive at realism – “only those who are                  mystical are realistic.” Once Jason tears off Medea’s                  “perfectly real” silicone skin, she scratches her real leg                  over the sharp edge of a wooden platform.</p>                <p>To add to the opera’s perfect combination of music and                  movement, yet another sensory line: some thirty butoh-village                  performers, steadily moving from backstage through the                  audience, their gaze steadily fixed on the horror which only                  their eyes can see. Barefoot, with cobblestones on their                  heads, they slowly walk over freezing ground, and the                  audience, again, can empathize with no effort. Yet another                  thread is our freedom to move across the space, choosing a                  different perspective each time, yet another – the sun going                  down slowly, in its own pace.</p>                <p>Once the listener immerses into visual agony and is                  completely captivated by the couple, something remarkable                  happens. The sun goes down, the music switches from                  lightly-colored silence to scream, the thirty dancers                  “suddenly” emerge behind our backs, and, having passed the                  audience, they acquire voice. Once everything reverses, the                  suffering experienced by Medea and Jason is no longer there –                  it reverses into silence and stillness of our tortured hearts,                  from realism to mystery.</p>                <p style="text-align:right;"><em>Erlena Dlu</em></p>                <br>                <i>Kiev, 2016<br>                  <br>                </i>TEASER: <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pFPVRHrNmTQ">https://youtu.be/pFPVRHrNmTQ</a><br>                <br>                <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/pFPVRHrNmTQ"><br>                </a><img style="width: 895px; height: 566px;" alt="Medea" src="photo/medea%201.jpeg"><br>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <!-- Bootstrap core JavaScript    ================================================== -->    <!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster -->    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>    <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="../../assets/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script>    <script src="dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>    <script>      (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){      (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),      m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)      })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');      ga('create', 'UA-90625354-1', 'auto');      ga('send', 'pageview');    </script>  </body></html>
