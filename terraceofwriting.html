                    person, obsessed with writing, has nearly become a perfect
                    character of the contemporary life: replenishing and

                    getting satisfaction – one way or another are everybody’s
                    concern. These complicated relationships with writing – from
                    the school pupil’s devotion to the text to the mute body’s
                    protest against the dictatorship of the signs, from the
                    official red tape to the elevated erotic relations with the
                    symbol, from the fascination with sensuality of writing to
                    the aversion to the carrion of figures and letters, - all
                    these are represented to the audience in ‘Hot Terrace’. </span><span

numbness,
                    inability to cry, internal overflow with signs, which lay in
                    the beginning of the performance – the character seems to be
                    catching his voice with his hands and violently pushing
                    something into his mouth, that emptiness, which is missing
                    inside – this is followed by the scene of the desperate
                    disintegration between the voice and the language, the body
                    and the sign, the perception and the memory. Then the
                    character finds a big phallic pencil, which he uses to draw
                    in the air, either conjuring his anxiety or obsessively
                    drawing out his symptom, trying to set himself free, to
                    throw out a letter itching inside, separate himself from it,
                    or fumbling like a blind man with a cane the outlines of his
                    future physicality. The blood-vascular symptom emerges at
                    the point of the overwhelming and thickening of the signs,
                    at that part of the body, where the carnal is not set apart
                    from the symbolic, hence the spasms always remind of a
                    desperate fight between the live flesh for emancipation from
                    the authority of the sing patterns. The writing becomes a
                    form of finding the corporeality, laying on his own flesh
                    throughout the symbolic layers of being, the creation of his
                    own chain of traces, the history of his milestones. Writing
                    out the live body on top of the emptiness of indifferent
                    matter, discharging, contortion, ejection, followed by the
                    masochistic delight with the phallic writing. </span><span

as

                    assumed as castration, written as the loss primed with pain,
                    as this is only in the writing where the loss can be
                    detected and only then the physicality can be marked with a
                    sign of castration and loss. In other words, the language
                    can be taken away only from that one, who is being possessed
                    by it, who is overwhelmed with it. This approach and
                    estrangement of the symbol from the body turns into a
                    refined erotic play and arouses the desire and the protest,
                    the passion and the aversion, the pain and the delight. </span><span

                    strictly along the straight lines of the chessboard. This

                    not just a story, but a concept, in this case the concept of
                    splitting. Two characters, two instances, two modes of
                    expression, two scenes: the scene of writing and the scene
                    of body, brought apart in the space as well as in the time.
                    To find out the points of their clinch and the irretrievable
                    gaps is the aim of Poema Theater performance. The female
                    character is drafting with the chalk some unknown writings
                    onto the board while the male body is being overwhelmed by
                    the spasms and convulsions now and again – two different
                    modes of expressiveness, conversional protest in this case
                    becomes the proText, written by the performing act, the
                    product of the sings factory manufacture. </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Times;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:

the
                    male character falls out of the curtains drawing the ladder
                    with himself, which, as we surprisingly find out, turns out
                    to be not only a subject, but the letter ‘A’, that letter
                    which he finally manages to separate from himself, to give
                    birth to it out of the darkness of the backstage; this very
                    subject becomes a fetish, a transitory object (something
                    like the turquoise high boots, which are being worn by both
                    characters in turns), mediating their relationships further
                    on: when he steps onto the steps of the ladder, she starts
                    to shake the ladder, takes it away from him until finally
                    she gets inside and starts dancing with it. So, the letter
                    becomes an object, Az-fetish, literally creating the frame
                    of the physicality and erotic relationships. Placed apart
                    the tops of the jackboots, spread apart the legs of the
                    female character in one of the final scenes – all of them in
                    one or another way follow the pattern of this ‘Az’, that
                    sacred symbol, which each of the characters is eager to
                    possess, which they want to make immortal in their bodies. </span><span

                    front curtain, hiding another stage behind it. There we can
                    see the Protogon, holding the cocoon of intertwined bodies
                    of the characters braking throughout the thin shell. Behind
                    the curtain there is an egg, in the egg there is sex, in sex
                    there is death. This is the finale of this performance
                    written with the bodies. The finale form - the show inside
                    the show – repeats the idea that the body is built inside
                    the functioning of the writing and that the writing
