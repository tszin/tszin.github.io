These complicated relationships with writing – from                    the school pupil’s devotion to the text to the mute body’s                    protest against the dictatorship of the signs, from the                    official red tape to the elevated erotic relations with the                    symbol, from the fascination with sensuality of writing to                    the aversion to the carrion of figures and letters, - all                    these are represented to the audience in ‘Hot Terrace’. </span><span                    style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Times;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2"><o:p></o:p></span></p>                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:17.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Times;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2">Der                    Symptomsbrief <o:p></o:p></span></p>                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:18.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2">Spasm,
numbness,
                    inability to cry, internal overflow with signs, which lay in                    the beginning of the performance – the character seems to be                    catching his voice with his hands and violently pushing                    something into his mouth, that emptiness, which is missing                    inside – this is followed by the scene of the desperate                    disintegration between the voice and the language, the body                    and the sign, the perception and the memory. Then the                    character finds a big phallic pencil, which he uses to draw                    in the air, either conjuring his anxiety or obsessively                    drawing out his symptom, trying to set himself free, to                    throw out a letter itching inside, separate himself from it,                    or fumbling like a blind man with a cane the outlines of his                    future physicality. The blood-vascular symptom emerges at                    the point of the overwhelming and thickening of the signs,                    at that part of the body, where the carnal is not set apart                    from the symbolic, hence the spasms always remind of a                    desperate fight between the live flesh for emancipation from                    the authority of the sing patterns. The writing becomes a                    form of finding the corporeality, laying on his own flesh                    throughout the symbolic layers of being, the creation of his                    own chain of traces, the history of his milestones. Writing                    out the live body on top of the emptiness of indifferent                    matter, discharging, contortion, ejection, followed by the                    masochistic delight with the phallic writing. </span><span                    style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Times;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2"><o:p></o:p></span></p>                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:18.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2">Just

                    a postfact this separation of the flesh from the sign can be                    assumed as castration, written as the loss primed with pain,                    as this is only in the writing where the loss can be                    detected and only then the physicality can be marked with a                    sign of castration and loss. In other words, the language                    can be taken away only from that one, who is being possessed                    by it, who is overwhelmed with it. This approach and                    estrangement of the symbol from the body turns into a                    refined erotic play and arouses the desire and the protest,                    the passion and the aversion, the pain and the delight. </span><span                    style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Times;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2"><o:p></o:p></span></p>                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:18.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2">This

his
                    constant device, Valentin Tszin brings out onto the stage                    not just a story, but a concept, in this case the concept of                    splitting. Two characters, two instances, two modes of                    expression, two scenes: the scene of writing and the scene                    of body, brought apart in the space as well as in the time.                    To find out the points of their clinch and the irretrievable                    gaps is the aim of Poema Theater performance. The female                    character is drafting with the chalk some unknown writings                    onto the board while the male body is being overwhelmed by                    the spasms and convulsions now and again – two different                    modes of expressiveness, conversional protest in this case                    becomes the proText, written by the performing act, the                    product of the sings factory manufacture. </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Times;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2"><o:p></o:p></span></p>                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:18.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2">Eventually
the
                    male character falls out of the curtains drawing the ladder                    with himself, which, as we surprisingly find out, turns out                    to be not only a subject, but the letter ‘A’, that letter                    which he finally manages to separate from himself, to give                    birth to it out of the darkness of the backstage; this very                    subject becomes a fetish, a transitory object (something                    like the turquoise high boots, which are being worn by both                    characters in turns), mediating their relationships further                    on: when he steps onto the steps of the ladder, she starts                    to shake the ladder, takes it away from him until finally                    she gets inside and starts dancing with it. So, the letter                    becomes an object, Az-fetish, literally creating the frame                    of the physicality and erotic relationships. Placed apart                    the tops of the jackboots, spread apart the legs of the                    female character in one of the final scenes – all of them in                    one or another way follow the pattern of this ‘Az’, that                    sacred symbol, which each of the characters is eager to                    possess, which they want to make immortal in their bodies. </span><span                    style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Times;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2"><o:p></o:p></span></p>                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:18.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;color:#EEECE1;mso-themecolor:background2">In                    the finale of the performance the backdrop also becomes the                    front curtain, hiding another stage behind it. There we can                    see the Protogon, holding the cocoon of intertwined bodies                    of the characters braking throughout the thin shell. Behind                    the curtain there is an egg, in the egg there is sex, in sex                    there is death. This is the finale of this performance                    written with the bodies. The finale form - the show inside                    the show – repeats the idea that the body is built inside                    the functioning of the writing and that the writing                    manifests the physicality; you can call ‘the body’ only                    something which is already written, noticed, imprinted on                    the other stage.
