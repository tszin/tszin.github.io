                    so Valentin Tszin marks his artistic method of not only                    creation of a performance, but also the philosophical                    approach to understanding of oneself in the contemporary                    world and its discourses.<br>                    <br>                    Valentin’s biography itself contains the dynamics giving                    birth to the principles that drive him it at the moment.<br>                    Basic education as a drama theater and film actor, and broad                    work experience in Russian theater and cinema, provided                    Valentin a set of basic techniques, where the actor is the                    conductor of the role, the plot, the author or the other                    source, that could be even a politician or an ideology.                    Before entering the acting school Valentin got a degree of a                    Taekwondo Master that granted him not only the basic                    physical skills of mastering the body, but the basic                    patterns of discipline and hierarchical understanding of the                    world.<br>                    Much later, after abandoning his actor career in theater and                    cinema, Valentin became interested in the post-modernist                    theories of understanding the world and creation of art.                    Physical theater and butoh gave the main keys to creating                    his first personal system of teaching and work on oneself.                    That method, called "theatre of the body semiotics", where                    the main driving component was comprehension of own body as                    a set of codes, re-coding of which leads to the creation of                    "another world", was realised in his Russian company                    PoemaTheatre, created in 2009 in collaboration with other                    contemporary Russian artists.<br>                    Since then, Valentin tours extensively around the world and                    cooperates with many modern experimenters.<br>                    Curious about, denying any kind of dominance in art as a                    protest against the system of "art as a tool of power,"                    Valentin himself became dictator of his own project.</span></span><span                  style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"></span><br>                <span class="_4n-j _3cht fsl" data-testid="event-permalink-details"><span                    class="text_exposed_show"><br>                    <br>                    Being a part of the neo-liberal European context of                    contemporary philosophy and art, Valentin wonders again                    about the artist as an out-personal space of the world and                    his impact on the construction of the future post-machine                    world.<br>                    <br>                    "Alien", it’s not a metaphor on a person who escaped from                    real civilization into non-real dimension of his art, on the                    contrary, it’s a meeting of a human being with a human                    being, in a situation of one-on-one in real time and space                    of action. Moreover, this is interaction of present and                    perceived in the dynamics of the birth of the third, the                    "Other", perhaps someone else in the future.</span></span><i><span                    class="_4n-j _3cht fsl"                    data-testid="event-permalink-details"><span                      class="text_exposed_show"><br>                    </span></span> <br>                  2014</i> </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <!-- Bootstrap core JavaScript    ================================================== -->    <!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster -->    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>    <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="../../assets/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script>    <script src="dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>    <script>      (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){      (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),      m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)      })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');      ga('create', 'UA-90625354-1', 'auto');      ga('send', 'pageview');    </script>  </body></html>
